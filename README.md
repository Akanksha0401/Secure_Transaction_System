# Secure Transaction System

This project focuses on making a secure transaction system, where instead of the UPI Pins or OTPs, that we use or payment, we can use the face recognition system. It is made such as at the time of payment instead of entering pins/passwords a window will pop up and it will access camera of the device which will try to recognise the face of the person standing in front of the camera of device. SO, the payment is successful only after the face of the person is recognised. There are three different methods of payment in the application namely, UPI Payment, Net Banking and Card Payment.

This idea of payment after face recognition can also be used for different ATM transactions where the ATM Machine can will have a camera which will be used for face recognition.
